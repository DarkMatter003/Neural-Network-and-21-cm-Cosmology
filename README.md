# Neural-Network-and-21-cm-Cosmology
So far I have included the Python code for Foreground parameter extraction from publicly available data (https://loco.lab.asu.edu/edges/edges-data-release/). The Foreground modelling has been taken from https://doi.org/10.1038/nature25792.

The Neural Network model for cosmological global 21-cm signal parameter extraction will be updataed soon.
